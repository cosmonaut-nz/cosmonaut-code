The findings are given per source file and separated by a linebreak ('\n'). The audience for this summary is executive level and non-technical. No technical terms should be used; use simple, clear terms. Keep the summary at a maximum 1000 characters."

            "content": "Concisely summarise the following: The code in 'build.rs' does not appear to contain critical errors or security issues. The use of imports could be refined, and the string conversion for static strings could be optimized for better code quality and readability. The code contains a high severity security issue related to the potential leaking of API keys, and a couple of errors that impact the clarity and security of the configuration data handling. The code does not adhere strictly to the best practices regarding secure configuration management. An improvement is suggested to enhance the security by modifying the Debug trait implementation for sensitive data. The Rust source code provides prompt templates for a chat-based language model. There are no critical errors or security vulnerabilities within the code. Minor improvements suggested include handling JSON schemas and multi-line strings separately from the code, renaming a public function to adhere to naming conventions, and enhancing a documentation comment for clarity. The code could lead to security vulnerabilities due to the exposure of sensitive API keys and lack of a backoff strategy in API request retries. Code improvements suggested include better error handling patterns, reorganizing the enumeration definition into its separate module, and deriving the Debug trait for better logging support. The use of wildcard imports should be replaced with specific imports for clarity and maintainability. The code review did not find any critical errors or security issues. Suggested improvements focus on adding documentation, implementing better error handling, and refactoring the trait for conversion functions to accept iterators for greater flexibility."

            "content": "Overview: The software primarily deals with a build script, configuration management for a review application, prompt structure definitions, and communication handling with language model services. Security: The handling of sensitive data could be improved, particularly in avoiding exposure during user interactions and logging. No critical security vulnerabilities were found.Quality: The code generally adheres to language standards, with recommended enhancements for better organisation, readability, naming consistency, and reusability. Error handling could also be improved. Conclusion: Overall, the software is functionally stable with opportunities for optimisation. With particular attention to the secure management of sensitive data and fine-tuning of code practices, it could achieve higher excellence."
